# mrgoogleypoo
Raspberry pi project made with my daughters that reads the opening paragraphs from a selection of novels when a button is pressed. The pi and button are housed in a small cardboard box with a face drawn on the top, the large red button is the nose. 

Espeak struggles after a few words and turns into a stretched out, Daleky voice. I've tried playing with the settings and have searched for solutions to this but with no luck. But it still works :)
